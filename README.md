# Java Programming Practice

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 👩‍💻✨

This is where I share all the code I’m learning and practicing as part of my coding journey. Every day I try to learn something new, solve problems, and become better — step by step!

## 📚 What you’ll find here
- Java programs for basic problems
- Practice with basic conditions,loops, conditionals, functions, and patterns
- Notes and examples from lectures I follow
- My coding experiments and learning progress

## 🙏 Why I started this
I believe small steps lead to big changes. Coding helps train my mind.

## 🤝 Let’s connect!
